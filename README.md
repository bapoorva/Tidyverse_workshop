# Tidyverse_workshop

This repository had the script. that we will use today (05/02/2025) for our hands-on tidyverse workshop as well as some dummy test data files to work with. 

Please download the testdata folder and install tidyverse package using 

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Note: If you are unable to install tidyverse, please make sure you install tidyr, dplyr, gpglot2 and tibble using 
```
install.packages(c("tidyr","dplyr","ggplot2","tibble"))
```
